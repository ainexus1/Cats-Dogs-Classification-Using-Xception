# Cats and Dogs Classification Using Pretrained Xception Model

This repository contains a simple project that demonstrates how to build a binary classification model using the pre-trained Xception model. The task involves classifying images of cats and dogs.

## Features
- Uses the Xception model pre-trained on ImageNet.
- Implements image preprocessing and normalization.
- Fine-tunes the model by adding custom dense layers.
- Includes precision, recall, and binary accuracy metrics.
- Demonstrates the entire pipeline from loading data to evaluating the model.
